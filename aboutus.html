              <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
              <p class="menudesc">An opportunity to provide jobs and training for the Hard to Employ by selling to the public freshly made
                  gourmet soups, salads and breads made daily.</p>
              <hr>
              <h2>Alm's Soup in Sixty Seconds:</h2>
              <p class="menudesc">We are building a new kitchen to serve 8,500 meals per month that will support the nutritional
                  needs of women, children and men serviced by the Bakersfield Homeless Center and the Mission at Kern
                  County.</p>
              <p class="menudesc">Alms Soup is a non-profit organization that serves our community by providing job and job skill
                  opportunities to those who are considered displaced in the workforce.</p>
              <p class="menudesc">Alms Soup will provide a humble soup, salad and bread made fresh each day for sale to the local
                  community.</p>
              <hr>
              <h2>Why a soup kitchen?</h2>
              <p class="menudesc">I’m a chef and I have worked with the best in our community to create fantastic food service operations. I
                  have also worked for the neediest of our community to provide wholesome food. It is the latter statement
                  that caused me to think about building a soup kitchen. The experiences I have had working with
                  innovative recovery-based programs such as Recovery Innovations Freise HOPE House in Bakersfield,
                  California, proved to me that nutrition is an integral and very important part of this healing process. <em>For a
                  little over one year, I learned that nutritiously dense foods have a positive effect on mental health
                  recovery.</em></p>
              <p class="menudesc">My experiences with Henrietta Weill Memorial Child Guidance Clinic of Bakersfield, California, gave me
                  insight to how the education of nutrition impacts wellbeing in education. With the help of friends who
                  insisted I do this and the facilities of the Bakersfield Masonic Temple Association along with volunteer
                  Masons, we organized and taught basic cooking classes to “At Risk” children ages 8-14 over the course of
                  an 8-week period. We held two such classes and one further class teaching basic work skills to T.A.Y.*
                  kids to prepare them to successfully obtain the food safety card needed to work for any restaurant.
                  (*Transitional age youth are young people between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four who are
                  transitioning out of foster care and into independence.)</p>
              <hr>
              <h2>Still.. why a soup kitchen?</h2>
              <p class="menudesc">A few years ago, a very good friend said I should start a soup kitchen. Immediately I misunderstood his
                  advice and jumped to the idea of feeding women, children and others. He was talking about a restaurant.
                  To his credit, he eventually agreed that women and children who could not pay was the smarter way to go.
                  Then as friends do, he asked me how?</p>
              <p class="menudesc">That “how” became very complicated and so the idea seeded and grew. The basic issue is economy. The
                  first hundred ideas based on donation seemed inefficient. Most charities spend more time raising funds
                  than actual producing. We did find two excellent examples of building a business model that donate
                  profits.</p>
              <blockquote cite="http://www.goodwillnm.org/the-goodwill-blog" class="menudesc">Building a business model like that of Goodwill Industries was an indication that I am on the right track.
                  “Goodwill Industries International earns $5 billion revenue per year, and we spend about 83 cents of every dollar on
                  programs and services for people in need.”
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-left: 60px;"><small>-<a target="_blank" href="http://www.goodwillnm.org/the-goodwill-blog">GoodWillNM.org</a></small></p>
              <p class="menudesc">And BARC’s** similar business model has a Mission Statement to:</p>
              <blockquote class="menudesc">
                “build a stronger community by
                  helping people with intellectual and developmental disabilities achieve individual goals for a better life.”
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-left: 60px"><small>**BARC is an acronym for Bakersfield ARC<sup><a href="http://barc-inc.org/about/our-legacy/">1</a></sup></small></p>
              <p class="menudesc">Both organizations continue to grow by providing goods and services for the community to use or
                  purchase. Whether it was a donation of clothes, old appliances or furniture in the case of Goodwill or
                  cans, glass, paper and other recyclables in the case of BARC, the models built a self-sustaining enterprise.</p>
              <p class="menudesc">Now the question became: how to do that with food.</p>
              <p class="menudesc">In order to donate prepared foods to any food bank the food must come from a bona fide food service
                  operation. In order to have a bona fide food service operation, a facility and labor are required as well as
                  basic operating capital for inventory, insurance, utilities and much more. Another priority is a strong
                  organizational structure.</p>
